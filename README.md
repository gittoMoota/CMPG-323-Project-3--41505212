# **Registration and Login**#

Upon launching the app, new users must create an account by registering their preferred email address and a unique password. After successfully registering and confirming their email address, a success message will be displayed. The user can then proceed to log in with the correct registered details. The user can log out from the app using the logout button at the top right of the page.

# **Client Registration**#

After successfully logging in, the user must register/create a new client from the Client tab, before creating a new project. The clientId is a unique identifier that is typically represented as a 36-character string, including hyphens, in the format 8-4-4-4-12, for example, 3F2504E0-4F89-11D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301. The client's primary contact email and date onboarded should not be left null.
